<h1>Hersheypark - September 16 and 17, 2023</h1>

<p>It&#39;s been a fun year as a season passholder at Hersheypark, but it seems that my and my wife&#39;s visits to Hershey have come to an end given our schedule for the rest of the year. Also because they don&#39;t open a lot of the rides for their Christmas event, but oh well.</p>
<p>We decided to book &quot;one last weekend&quot; in Hershey for the year, and lucked out as it ended up being the first weekend for Hersheypark Dark Nights. It was great and I&#39;ll get into that <em>after</em> I talk about the rides.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wildcat&#39;s Revenge</strong> (3x - various middle cars) - Every time I ride this, I find something new about it that I absolutely love. This time around, the laterals combined with the airtime moments are really what gobsmacked me. RMC had the audacity to combine their intense ejector air with crazy unbanked turns, and I think it&#39;s one of the defining qualities of this coaster. It&#39;s the best ride at Hersheypark and maybe the best RMC conversion I&#39;ve ever been on (the other two being SteVe and Wicked Cyclone, which are also amazing). WCR&#39;s ejector air rivals or even surpasses that of Skyrush except for maybe Skyrush&#39;s first drop. This was a lot of fun in the rain too.</li>
<li><strong>Storm Runner</strong> (3x - front/mid/mid) - This is still one of my favorites in the park. The launch is <em>so</em> punchy, and this ride&#39;s airtime hits especially hard from the front. In the front, the top hat has wild ejector air, and the inversions feel just a bit whippier. This ride was fantastic at night, especially through the Dark Nights fog. We managed to snag a ride on Sunday when it briefly opened during a gap in the rain.</li>
<li><strong>Skyrush</strong> (1x, second-to-last row) - I wanted to get back left wing seat again for this, but kept getting boxed out by ADA passes. We just moved the next row over and it was I would say about 85% as good as the real back row. The ejector air is legendary, and the laterals on the Stengel dives are absolutely ridiculous. This is the most intense coaster at the park by far, probably the most intense in the state... maybe the region. If you take the &quot;secret path&quot; along the creek, you can watch the cable lift in action.</li>
<li><strong>Fahrenheit</strong> (1x, second-to-back) - Intamin&#39;s Eurofighter ripoff is Hershey&#39;s most underrated coaster. A fantastic 97-degree first drop, some unique inversions including the Norwegian loop, and a blindsiding airtime pop at the finale. There&#39;s a little bit of shaking on this coaster but nothing headache-inducing. More of a vibration. Maybe it just needs new wheels or something, as it definitely shakes more this year than it did last year.</li>
<li><strong>Great Bear</strong> (2x, middle/front) - A modern classic B&amp;M invert with fantastic views of the park, an excellent pre-drop helix and first drop, and some whippy inversions. Everything you want from a B&amp;M invert. This is an amazing front row ride, but it was nearly painful in the rain, as you&#39;re going so fast that the raindrops might as well be hail.</li>
<li><strong>Candymonium</strong> (2x, middle/back) - Hershey&#39;s other hyper is a far gentler B&amp;M with absolutely fantastic flojector airtime, and some really unique profiling in places. The setting around the Chocolatetown entrance and fountain is nice. I can&#39;t wait to see what the park does with all this open space. I actually left myself some airtime room, which is something I&#39;m usually too scared to try, and it was fantastic. Guess I&#39;ll be doing that more often now. We managed to get last-train-of-the-night on Saturday after sprinting all the way from Lightning Racer.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Racer</strong> (2x, Thunder side) - This is another that I feel has reached modern classic status at Hershey, but my last two rides on it were rougher than they ever have been. This might be a good candidate for Gravity Group retracking, Titan Track, or 208 ReTraK. There&#39;s no way they&#39;d renovate it to the point of making it more thrilling as it has too much to offer as a family-friendly coaster, but smoothing out the current layout would pay dividends. My final ride on it was so slow that I was worried we would valley. I guess there was too much weight in the back of the train. Easter egg for the Thunder side: When you get back to the station, look down into the maintenance area to see the park&#39;s nativity scene in storage for the holiday event.</li>
<li><strong>Jolly Rancher Remix</strong> (2x) - I find myself enjoying this coaster more and more every time I ride it. I know it&#39;s a Vekoma Boomerang, but the vest restraints and new theming really help the ride, and it&#39;s not all that rough. It&#39;s a great intense Boomerang that doesn&#39;t at all show its age (30+ years now). They replaced the lift music with spooky Halloween music for the event.</li>
<li><strong>Comet</strong> (2x, middle/back) - This is a true Hershey icon and a timeless vintage woodie that will never die. Hershey takes great care of it, and it has some surprising pops of airtime here and there. Overall, though, it&#39;s not as intense as other vintage woodies nearby like the two big boys at Knoebels.</li>
<li><strong>SooperDooperLooper</strong> (2x, middle) - Schwarzkopf coasters are a dying breed but this one still provides a great ride. An intense vertical loop with great positive Gs followed by what is essentially a terrain mine train. The lift hill runs slow and suspect, which makes me think they may need to replace that motor imminently.</li>
<li><strong>Laff Trakk</strong> (1x) - This is a cool indoor Maurer spinner with great funhouse theming, but the line is usually backbreakingly long. Early on Saturday, the line was not bad, so we managed to hop on with a very short wait. For the Halloween event, all of the theming is turned off, so the ride is pitch black. That&#39;s fine I guess, but I really like it better with the lights on. Heh.</li>
<li><strong>Trailblazer</strong> (1x) - Glad to see Hershey got their lone Arrow coaster up and running again. This ride is <em>shockingly</em> smooth for an Arrow mine train. It&#39;s a perfect coaster for kids, families, just about everybody can ride it. There is a pretty nice helix section towards the end, and some great tunnels. This closes at 5 PM during the Halloween event to make room for haunted house queues.</li>
<li><strong>Wild Mouse</strong> (0x) - As far as I know, this was not open during my visit. It&#39;s a good Wild Mouse, but I think its time is coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hershey also offers some wonderful flats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aquatheater</strong> - A great seal/sea lion show that lasts about 20 minutes. We love animals so this is always a can&#39;t-miss for me and my wife.</li>
<li><strong>ZOOAMERICA</strong> - Likewise. Hershey&#39;s zoo focuses on North American wildlife. Love seeing the big cats, prairie dogs, bears, and wolves.</li>
<li><strong>Coal Cracker</strong> - Sadly closed for the season after Labor Day. This is my favorite flat at Hershey. Great old Arrow log flume with a freaky last drop.</li>
<li><strong>Monorail</strong> - Timeless monorail ride around the park. Unironically my mom&#39;s favorite ride at the park.</li>
<li><strong>Carrousel</strong> - This unusually-spelled vintage merry-go-round sports a real band organ, which for the Halloween event, was playing &quot;spooky&quot; classics including Ghostbusters, the Addams Family theme, and the Purple People Eater.</li>
<li><strong>Reese&#39;s Cupfusion</strong> - Believe it or not, this visit was the first time I ever went on this. No wait at rope drop on a rainy Sunday morning. Cool little shooter ride, probably great for the kids, but I would definitely not wait 90+ minutes like the line normally is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crowds were pretty light on Saturday early afternoon and really only got a bit denser just before the Halloween stuff kicked in. Even then, most lines were not too bad, as the haunted houses are big time attractions with long queues. Sunday was a rainy day, so the park was really quite dead, but Hershey managed to run everything that wasn&#39;t an Intamin all day. They somehow managed to get Storm Runner going during a break in the rain, and we got on the last ride before it closed again for the weather. Great timing!</p>
<p>Hershey&#39;s Halloween event is really well-done. The decorations around the midways are fantastic, the fog is really cool, and the scare actors are super into it and seem to be having a good time. We only had time for one haunted house, but it was definitely a higher-budget operation than what we&#39;ve seen in other parks. Other people online compare Hershey&#39;s Halloween event to Universal&#39;s, and I could imagine the production values being pretty similar.</p>
<p>I thought the playlist in the park was really well-done too. Every song had some connection back to a spooky theme, and we heard 0 repeats over the course of a single day. Impressive when other parks can&#39;t manage to not repeat songs during the summer. Six Flags America, I&#39;m looking at you and your weird broken playing-too-slow mixtape thing you have going on.</p>
<p>The one bummer about the Halloween event is that they turn off a lot of the ride lights to create a darker atmosphere. I get it, but one of Hershey&#39;s best strengths is how awesome their ride lights are. Lightning Racer and Comet have some of the most gorgeous lights of any coaster I know, and Wildcat&#39;s Revenge has some decent effects on the lift hill. I know some people prefer total dark rides in general, but man those lights are just fantastic and need to be on as often as possible. At least they kept the Ferris Wheel lit.</p>
<p>We stayed at the Comfort Inn near the Harrisburg Airport about 20 minutes away. It was a really good deal for the room, and the hotel was surprisingly nice. Definitely pays off to stay 15 - 20 minutes out of town, as staying in Hershey proper always costs an arm and a leg. My family used to stay at the Hershey Lodge back in the day, which is owned by Hershey Resorts and Entertainment, but now that hotel is routinely $400+/night during the season. That&#39;s more expensive than a lot of the Disney/Universal Orlando resort hotels, and it&#39;s literally just a decent hotel with a park shuttle service.</p>
<p>This is less about the park and more about me now. Just over a year ago for Labor Day weekend, my wife and I took an impromptu trip to Hersheypark. I bought her Six Flags passes for Christmas since I knew she liked roller coasters, and we had a good time at Universal and Disney on our honeymoon the year before. I spent that entire summer sitting out most of the coasters except smaller woodies, mine trains, and wild mice. But I was really <em>interested</em> in the coasters themselves, and she just seemed like she was having so much fun on them.</p>
<p>I chose Hershey because it was the park I was most comfortable at, having visited so often as a kid. I was determined to conquer my fear of 200ft coasters and inversions.  I knew Candymonium and SooperDooperLooper would be good candidates to do it. I managed to get on both, white knuckle for sure, but it was the push I needed to do the rest of them. I rode every coaster in Hershey at least twice that weekend. It spurred an obsession for me. In less than a year, I accrued 85 new credits. Many of them came from Six Flags Fright Fest visits late last year to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/zp3gh7/trip_report_six_flags_great_adventure_12172022/">Great Adventure</a> and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/y1dm1l/trip_report_six_flags_new_england_109_and_10102022/">New England</a>, as well as a stop at <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/y1bznd/trip_report_lake_compounce_1082022/">Lake Compounce</a>. Several more came on a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/14a4iza/trip_report_road_trip_day_1_knoebels_friday_622023/">massive 10-day road trip</a> this past summer to Knoebels, Waldameer, Cedar Point, Kings Island, Kennywood, Hershey, and Dorney.</p>
<p>Almost exactly one year after cracking that fear wide open, having this last trip to Hersheypark felt quite poetic. And that ride on Candymonium on Saturday night was just a little emotional. I guess I&#39;ll show you why:</p>

</ol>
<p>For those of you who have read and followed along with any of my trip reports this year and last fall/winter, I sincerely thank you for coming along on this journey. There is more goodness to come. We hopped on Six Flags Diamond passes this year during the big sale, and I have a good feeling there is a Carowinds/KD/BGW/SFA road trip in the works next summer, and maybe even a stop at SFGAm. I went almost 30 years not riding this things and now I gotta make up for lost time. Oh my poor wife.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hershey&#39;s lineup is elite and I will not be taking any shit about this</li>
<li>They&#39;re running a fantastic Halloween event, and crowds were actually pretty light</li>
<li>I love roller coasters man</li>
