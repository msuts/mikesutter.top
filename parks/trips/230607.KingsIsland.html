<h1>Kings Island - June 7 and 8, 2023</h1>

<p>After four days of nonstop amusement park action, my wife and I were exhausted. We took a &quot;break day&quot; in Cincinnati, seeing the zoo and experiencing our first Skyline Chili (btw - loved it). We went back to the hotel early and rested up, needing to be fresh for our next two days at the legendary Kings Island in Mason, Ohio.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll start with the coasters and rides, and address park quality, crowds, food, lodging, etc afterwards. Embedded photos may not be mine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/yr7UJ6ml.jpg">The Beast</a></strong> (x5 - front, middle, including 1 night time ride) - The Beast was truly the coaster that inspired this entire coaster road trip. I wanted to ride the longest woodie in the world. I wanted to experience the speed, the helix, the night rides. Before I conquered my fear of big steel coasters, the only ones I&#39;d touch were woodies. Infamously designed and built in-house by Kings Island in the late 1970s, the Beast is perhaps the most unique woodie in the world. It was the coaster I was most hyped to ride, and I was shaking with excitement when I strapped in for my first ride. Not only did this ride not disappoint in the slightest, it is now my #1 wooden coaster, surpassing the wonderful Boulder Dash up in Lake Compounce. There is truly NO OTHER RIDE in the world that matches the atmosphere of the Beast. The lift hill, slow at first to ensure the last train has cleared the block zone, then speeding up. At night, all you hear in the park is the echoing of the lift hill&#39;s chain bouncing off the woods, and the oddly creepy voiceover telling riders to stay seated. The first drop into the tunnel is an AMAZING feeling, and the ride immediately gives the impression of an out-of-control runaway train. I guess that really is what the Beast is: an overgrown mine train. The ride&#39;s sharp turns and unusual profiling betray its &quot;backyard coaster&quot; design. The sense of speed heading into the brake shed is fantastic, and the ride immediately begins to pick back up out of the shed. Oddly enough for me the most &quot;holy shit we&#39;re going to die&quot; feeling came just before the second lift hill. The profiling of that drop&#39;s pullout is so unusual and sharp and it looks like it&#39;s going to just annihiliate you, but it doesn&#39;t. The train veers left after the hill and the track banks oddly to the left. As you start to descend the hill, a trim catches the train and then suddenly releases, and you&#39;re off into the wildest, fastest-feeling helix I&#39;ve ever experienced. In the front this is a truly amazing element, but at night, you feel almost ghostly and ethereal as you rush through the wooded darkness. We were lucky to get on the second-to-last train of the night in real pitch-black darkness. This coaster is an 11/10 for me. I adored it and wanted to ride it over and over. Even my wife, who is not much for wooden coasters, loved this ride. I&#39;m looking at the Beast snowglobe on my desk as I write this and it makes me smile.</li>
<li><strong>Mystic Timbers</strong> (3x - front, middle, back) - I&#39;m not sure how KI considers the intensity of their rides when assigning them the rankings. How this ride is considered less intense than something like Backlot Stunt Coaster beats the hell out of me. This 2017 GCI woodie is a <em>fantastic</em> coaster with excellent theming. The Miami River Lumber theming at the entrance, throughout the queue, and in the station is very well done. Its top speed of 53 mph does not turn any heads, but with its tight banked turns and airtime hills, it feels much faster in effect. The ending in the shed is a bit weird, but I didn&#39;t realize the creature was random. The first two rides we got snakes, and the last ride we got bats. Mystic Timbers is the ride I expected Ravine Flyer to be.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ol3ipvSl.jpg">Diamondback</a></strong> (2x - middle) - This is a pretty good B&amp;M hyper with a solid 215 ft drop and awesome airtime, though the trim brake on the hill immediately after the turnaround makes me sad. The splashdown is a nice touch for observers but doesn&#39;t contribute to the ride experience. Overall I&#39;d say this has not unseated Candymonium as my favorite B&amp;M hyper, and I&#39;d probably rank Nitro ahead of it as well. I noticed a bit of a rumble during the pullouts of each drop that you don&#39;t really get on Nitro or Candy.</li>
<li><strong>Orion</strong> (2x - front, middle) - I enjoyed this pandemic-era B&amp;M giga, especially in the front. The airtime was solid from both parts of the train I rode in, and the drop feels like it lasts forever. I really enjoy the space theming. From the front, the 91 mph speed rips your face off, and the banked airtime hill feels like you&#39;re actually getting launched. I will say that the complaint that this ride is too short did ring true. I would have liked a slightly longer ride, even if it was just a couple more camelback hills.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/jXgotxvl.jpg">Banshee</a></strong> (1x, front) - I love B&amp;M inverts, and this one built in 2014 is easily the most intense I have ever ridden. A larger drop than Great Bear with whippier, more intense forces than the Batman clones. After the Beast, this was my wife&#39;s favorite ride in the park. The color scheme is gorgeous, and the vest restraints mean any potential roughness won&#39;t pinball your head around. Usually I just yell a bit on coasters, but this one actually made me go WHOA and HOLY SHIT a couple of times. I desperately wanted a second ride on this, but a bad stomach cramp brought my second day at Kings Island to a screeching halt. </li>
<li><strong>Flight of Fear</strong> (2x - middle, back) - We tried to get on this ride early on day 1, and the friendly staff member at the entrance told us that the ride&#39;s line was moving slowly and we&#39;d be better off coming back later. We returned later that night and the line was still slow, but we decided to stick around anyway. I&#39;ve never been on such an intense indoor/dark coaster and I really enjoyed it! This 1996 Premier coaster has fantastic space/alien theming in the queue and station, a punchy LIM launch, and an intense &quot;spaghetti bowl&quot; of inversions with a couple of surprising airtime moments, and a great last corkscrew. I really enjoyed this one! I would definitely utilize the ala carte skip-the-line pass on this coaster next time, though, as this line was the worst in the park. </li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7nNgC8Tl.jpg">Invertigo</a></strong> (1x, going backwards) - Vekoma Boomerangs are familiar to us all, but the inverted Boomerang is a far smoother, more intense ride. This one was built in 1999 as FACE/OFF. I enjoyed it, but didn&#39;t want to ride it a second time.</li>
<li><strong>Backlot Stunt Coaster</strong> (2x - middle, back) - This is another Premier launch coaster, nearly 10 years younger than Flight of Fear, with a wildly different theme and much less intense ride. The first launch is great and going straight into the helix is a nice unique feature. The fire element actually lets you feel the intense heat on your face before you drop into the dark portion of the ride. Unfortunately the splashdown element was dry for my visit, but still a fun ride anyway. One of the best &quot;family coasters&quot; I&#39;ve ridden.</li>
<li><strong>The Bat</strong> (2x - front, back) - I enjoyed Iron Dragon at Cedar Point, but this Arrow suspended coaster is six years newer and a much more complete/intense ride in every way. The ride itself is far removed from the rest of the park, which means the queue and the ride itself are uniquely quiet. The &quot;pod&quot; design of these cars is unusual and makes for an unsettling ride (in a good way). I love the swinging feeling, especially the wild fling as you pull into the brake run. I wish we had a decent Arrow suspended coaster on the east coast!</li>
<li><strong>The Racer</strong> (4x - 1x red, 3x blue) - I <em>absolutely loved</em> this legendary 1972 PTC racing woodie. Ever since I saw this coaster on the Brady Bunch as a child (syndicated on TV Land in like 2001 - I swear I&#39;m not THAT old), I wanted to visit this park and ride this coaster. I expected a rough, tame coaster with mild forces and a lackluster racing element. What I got was actually a decently smooth woodie with an AWESOME four-tracks-across visual, a really solid race, and some of the best airtime I&#39;ve felt on a ride of this era. My wife hated this ride and said it was too rough, but I couldn&#39;t get enough of it. She was out after one ride, but I hit it three more times alone. I rode in the last row on my 3rd ride and it was a bit too bumpy. The kind thoosie in front of me said to try the center row of the rear car next time, as the non-wheel seats were &quot;glass smooth.&quot; Not quite glass smooth but much more enjoyable. What a GREAT woodie. Kings Island has a truly elite woodie collection!</li>
<li><strong>Adventure Express</strong> (1x, middle) - Again the intensity rating gets called into question. This is rated a 5 - above Mystic Timbers and the Racer, and in line with Flight of Fear and Orion. What gives, KI?! In any case, this relatively young 1991 Arrow mine train has probably the best theming I&#39;ve ever seen on a mine train. It actually feels like a desert adventure, and the final lift hill actually reminds me of the beginning of Revenge of the Mummy in Universal. Speaking of that final lift hill... how anticlimactic. Unfortunately it runs a little bit rough, with virtually every adult on the train groaning by the end.</li>
<li><strong>Flying Ace Aerial Chase</strong> (1x, middle) - I&#39;d never been on a suspended family coaster and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going out of my way to find another. This one meandered and rattled a bit too much for it to be fun. Still, I like the idea of a suspended coaster for the kids to get them comfortable with the concept.</li>
<li><strong>Woodstock Express</strong> (0x) - Oops.</li>
</ul>
<p>The flat rides were pretty good here as well, with some unique attractions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> - Well this certainly brought out my fear of heights in full force. I spent about 7 seconds on the platform and walked right back into the elevator. I&#39;m dizzy just thinking about this. My wife liked it though.</li>
<li><strong>Dodgem</strong> - An unusual setup for bumper cars in that the circuit is round instead of rectangular. Looks cool but doesn&#39;t change much about the experience.</li>
<li><strong>Grand Carousel</strong> - A nice Carousel that runs a real organ that is woefully out-of-tune. For the musically-inclined reading this, the low brass was about a half step down from the rest of the organ, meaning it sounded like a hot farty mess. (For the non-musically inclined, play a key on the piano and then play the key immediately next to it, and you&#39;ll see the problem.)</li>
<li><strong>Viking Fury</strong> - A nice big Pirate Ship ride that&#39;s situated over the water. An appropriate location and a nice experience.</li>
<li><strong>Kings Island and Miami Valley Railroad</strong> - Nice train ride for a break, and I appreciate that it actually acts as a transportation method between the main park and the water park.</li>
<li><strong>Cargo Loco/Sol Spin</strong> - These are fresh and new Zamperla rides for the Adventure Port area. Sol Spin was not open during our visit, as they were just putting the finishing touches on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kings Island is one of the best amusement parks I have ever visited. I was excited to ride the Beast, but I absolutely fell in love with the rest of this park. The International Street theming is wonderful and the Eiffel Tower is a unique and fun touch. Just like Cedar Point, the park is immaculately maintained, landscaped, and manicured.</p>
<p>The lineup of rides is very strong, and overall I felt that the rides were a bit smoother and easier to ride than those at Cedar Point. That may just be a function of the intensity of the rides themselves. That being said, this lineup does feel like it is missing something. An intense Intamin, a big looping B&amp;M floorless, or an RMC Raptor would work really well here. After all, they do have space to fill now that Vortex is gone.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t too hard to find our way around, but the park itself is very large, so if you&#39;re by Banshee and you want to ride the Beast... you&#39;re going to be walking for a while!</p>
<p>I broke a personal rule and got a big meal at the park on day one. The burrito bowls looked real tasty, and they absolutely were. I&#39;d recommend if you don&#39;t mind having to wait a little while before doing basically anything with your day. I would skip the big meal if I were to return! Then again, hard to resist the siren song of Skyline Chili.</p>
<p>Much like Cedar Point, I thought the B&amp;Ms here had some roughness issues. Orion is barely three years old and there were some rattley moments in the pullouts of the drops. I would really like to know why Cedar Fair&#39;s B&amp;Ms feel this way, when I&#39;ve never had this experience at other parks. It doesn&#39;t really destroy the experience, especially on coasters with clamshell or vest restraints, but it&#39;s an interesting thing to note.</p>
<p>Of all the parks we visited, Kings Island was the most generous with its hours. Early entry allowed us into the gate at 9:30 AM and the park was open until 10 PM. This was on a Wednesday and Thursday! There is a great firework/drone show at 10 PM that we watched from the queue of the Beast.</p>
<p>Staying <em>in</em> Mason near the park is a bit pricey. We stayed a few minutes away in a nice area called Blue Ash. The hotel was reasonably priced and only about 10 minutes from the park.</p>
<p>Before our second day at the park, we caught breakfast at a decent little joint in Sharonville called Scramblers. It was a solid breakfast, not too heavy, and kept us going for a while. We hit up Skyline Chili on the way out of town as there&#39;s one basically across the street from the park.</p>
<p>We left around 6 PM on day two and picked up some merch from the gift shops. The shirts were actually pretty well-designed (no garish back prints) and I picked up a <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0066/7503/8277/products/SkylineHoodie1_1800x1800.png">really nice embroidered hoodie</a>. There were also some great magnets, the designs for Beast and Flight of Fear were especially cool. And I just <em>had</em> to get the Beast snowglobe.</p>
<p>The two &quot;centerpiece&quot; parks of the trip were now sadly behind us, but the fond memories will stand forever. We began the long drive to Pittsburgh to visit a strange playland of century-old woodies.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall one of the best amusements parks I&#39;ve ever visited</li>
<li>A great lineup of coasters with an elite collection of woodies</li>
<li>Beautifully maintained</li>
<li>The Beast fuckin&#39; rocks!</li>
