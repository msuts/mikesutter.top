<h1>Knoebels - June 2, 2023</h1>

<p>Last year I conquered a major fear and discovered a new hobby in roller coasters. In a buzzed moment at home around Christmas time, I told my wife that what I <em>really</em> wanted for my birthday and/or Christmas was the opportunity to ride more roller coasters.</p>
<p>She asked me what park I wanted to go to. I said my real goal would be Cedar Point, but I couldn&#39;t think of a good excuse to drive that far without making a whole big trip out of it.</p>
<p>So that is exactly what we did!</p>
<p>In the small town of Elysburg, PA exists one of the most bizarre amusement parks I have ever visited - the one and only <strong>Knoebels.</strong> I&#39;d never heard of Knoebels in all my years of visiting Hersheypark, just an hour south. I remember when Hershey was a park of old amusement rides and wooden coasters, and it sounded like Knoebels&#39; lineup was similar to old school Hershey. However, the <em>vibe</em> of the two parks could not be more different.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll start with the coasters and rides, and address park quality, crowds, food, etc afterwards. Embedded photos may not be mine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vKomFn8.jpeg">Phoenix</a></strong> (3x - front, middle, back) - This 1947 PTC coaster designed by Herb Schmeck originally operated as the Rocket at Playland Park in San Antonio, TX. It has been the Golden Ticket Awards #1 woodie for the last four years, and has consistently been one of their top 10 woodies since 1998. It&#39;s easy to see why this ride receives such critical acclaim. With the only restraints being old-fashioned buzz bars and providing a <em>ton</em> of ejector airtime, this is one of the wildest vintage woodies I&#39;ve ever been on. Your legs will hit the buzz bars several times over the course of the ride. Other Schmeck PTC coasters of its age, such as Comet at Hershey or Comet at Great Escape, don&#39;t pack the same punch. Pair that with an exceptionally smooth ride and you&#39;ve got a winner. This is a great ride from any part of the train, but the airtime is most sustained from the back row.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/QqHvQoR.jpeg">Flying Turns</a></strong> (2x) - Bobsled coasters have become exceptionally rare in recent years. Parts are harder to come by and maintenance is a real pain. Knoebels cares not for these issues as they spent nearly eight years building and tweaking this ride between 2006 and 2013. The line moves a little slowly due to the low capacity of the cars, but it&#39;s well worth the wait. While you won&#39;t be getting your typical coaster forces on this ride, the pure fun of rolling around the &quot;tunnels&quot; like you&#39;re a bunch of marbles or on a Hot Wheels track. I could ride this over and over.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/n0Ry9pw.jpeg">Twister</a></strong> (3x - front, middle, back) - In 1998, Knoebels wanted to buy the old Mister Twister coaster from the old defunct Elitch Gardens in Denver, CO. Two issues: the coaster had fallen into severe disrepair, and was just too large for the space Knoebels had. With heavy inspiration from the original John Allen blueprints, Knoebels built a brand new woodie. The result was nothing short of spectacular - in my opinion, this is the <em>best</em> ride at Knoebels. With two lift hills, TONS of laterals, a few pops of airtime, an epic double helix taken at full speed, and a good smooth ride, this coaster offers so much. While it may be tempting to ride in the back for optimal whippiness and airtime, the front is where it&#39;s at, because this thing hauls!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.centredaily.com/latest-news/lkd9af/picture41035860/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Y8spQ.So.42.jpeg">Impulse</a></strong> (1x) - Knoebels&#39; &quot;big&quot; steel coaster is a 2015 Zierer that is reminiscent of a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter with its vertical lift and intense inversions. The ride was smooth and forceful, and made me gray out on a sunny 95 degree day. The heat and dizziness made me only ride this once, but had the weather been more comfortable, I probably would have tried it again. The trains and restraints are minimal which really adds to the fear factor.</li>
<li><strong>Kozmo&#39;s Kurves</strong> (1x) - You might think this is just like any under E&amp;F Miler kiddie coaster. Well, ride in the back and get ready to get thrown around with absolutely no regard for your wellbeing.</li>
<li><strong>Black Diamond</strong> (1x) - Originally constructed as the desert-themed &quot;Golden Nugget&quot; in 1960, this ride was relocated to Knoebels in 2011 and reopened as a coal-mine-themed indoor dark coaster. The coaster itself is not intense, but the theming is old-school and pretty well done. How many decent rides out there are actually kind of educational? Be sure to check out the museum next door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knoebels has far more to offer than its coasters. For fans of classic carnival rides, this place might as well be heaven. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whipper</strong> - A century-old Mangels Whip ride</li>
<li><strong>Bumper Cars</strong> - 1940s bumper cars which hit real hard</li>
<li><strong>Flyer</strong> - Extra-fast flying scooters that can be easily &quot;snapped,&quot; closed when I visited.</li>
<li><strong>Satellite</strong> - The once-ubiquitous Roll-O-Plane that isn&#39;t seen much anymore</li>
<li><strong>Scenic Skyway</strong> - A ski-lift up the hill. Unfortunately closed the day of my visit.</li>
<li><strong>Downdraft</strong> - Never seen one of these before. Forceful and fun!</li>
<li><strong>Paratrooper</strong> - Your classic Paratrooper ride, also runs quite fast compared to others.</li>
<li><strong>Giant Wheel</strong> - A nice big Ferris Wheel with a long cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Super Round-Up</strong> - Mm, centrifugal force</li>
<li><strong>Pete&#39;s Fleet</strong> - A janky boat ride through a small canal with very low clearances under some bridges.</li>
<li><strong>Grand Carousel</strong> - A gorgeous 1913 Carousel with three organs and brass rings to grab.</li>
<li><strong>Old Smokey and Pioneer Trains</strong> - Old Smokey was closed on my visit. The Pioneer train was open, and it was a nice train ride through the woods. Some deer were chilling and napping just feet from the train, very cute to see.</li>
<li><strong>Haunted House</strong> - This costs extra money even with a wristband, and it&#39;s not worth it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This full-blown resort and campground could easily be the centerpiece of a long weekend summer trip. Bring a camper or rent one of the cottages on the park grounds. Parking is free, in mostly dirt or grass lots. They offer a waterpark and several good-looking dining options.</p>
<p>The park itself is organized in a clustered, somewhat meandering style, a bit hard to find your way around at first. Much of the park&#39;s paths are dirt or gravel, so don&#39;t wear shoes you worry about dirtying up. The best way to describe the Knoebels vibe is that of a never-ending carnival. The many fairground organs throughout provide the musical backdrop to this fever dream of a park. There&#39;s also, inexplicably, a building shaped like a <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVON_bqXoAEd3dI.jpg:large">massive loaf of bread</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to the grounds is free and you can buy tickets as you go if you don&#39;t want to ride too many things. My wife and I opted for the ride-all-day wristbands which, IMO, were a little bit pricey at $50 - but for a place this well-staffed and that commits itself to preserving hard-to-maintain attractions, I understand that you need to pay for it somewhere. With a variety of rides appealing to children, non-thrill-seekers, and coaster fans, you could bring anybody here.</p>
<p>Knoebels is reviving another old ride - the <a href="https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/dailyitem.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/0a/00afff56-99a9-11ec-8b82-ffa7ce8d2726/621e94202b7c1.image.jpg?crop=1172%2C1172%2C298%2C0&amp;resize=1200%2C1200&amp;order=crop%2Cresize">Bayern Kurve</a> - and apparently intends to run it at its &quot;full speed&quot; of 70mph... I say there is no chance they get it running that fast, but we&#39;ll see. They&#39;re certainly crazy enough to try.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an interesting building in the center of the park called the <a href="https://www.knoebels.com/data/uploads/media/image/Facination.JPG">Fascination parlor</a>. I&#39;ve never heard of or played this game before visiting Knoebels. Basically, if Skee-ball is checkers, then Fascination is chess. The attendants in the building gave my wife and I a few free tickets and I managed to win one round. The building is dead quiet and air-conditioned, so it&#39;s a good place to go and cool down if necessary.</p>
<p>The park opened at 12 and closed at 8, and I felt we had basically gotten everything done by 6 or so. Good call, since the skies opened up at 6:30 and likely closed a good portion of the park for the night. The lines on a Friday afternoon were not bad at all. The longest waits were for our two rides on Flying Turns. Phoenix and Twister were walk-ons basically all day. Ride ops were efficient and outstandingly friendly. Knoebels must be a nice place to work.</p>
<p>For the unique vibe of the park, and especially if you are a lover of vintage woodies and classic rides, Knoebels is a great place to visit. It manages to distinguish itself from other small, family-owned/operated parks with its wacky carnival vibe. I will for sure be returning someday!</p>
<p>My wife and I left a little after 6, a bit overheated and tired, feeling that we had done the park justice. We hit up a good roadside joint called the Twilight Diner in Loganton on the way to our next stop: Waldameer!</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unique family-run park that&#39;s like a never-ending carnival</li>
<li>Two amazing vintage (or vintage-inspired) woodies with Phoenix and Twister</li>
<li>A one-of-a-kind wooden bobsled coaster with Flying Turns</li>
<li>This park is committed to preserving amusement park traditions of bygone eras</li>
<li>Plenty of camping space and a bunch of park-owned cottages for rent</li>
<li>Excellent for all ages and price brackets</li>
</ul>
