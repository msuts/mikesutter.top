<h1>Kennywood - June 9, 2023</h1>

<p>After spending four days in Ohio&#39;s best amusement parks, we turned around and began our journey back to Long Island. Of course, we were not going to just drive straight through from Cincinnati. There&#39;s too many good parks on the way home! Our first stop after getting back to Pennsylvania was Kennywood. A small, unique park just outside Pittsburgh, home to three century-old woodies and some new modern coasters as well.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll start with the coasters and rides, and address park quality, crowds, food, lodging, etc afterwards. Embedded photos may not be mine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/IuKFOeel.jpg">Phantom&#39;s Revenge</a></strong> (2x, middle and back) - I was really hyped to get on this coaster. Built in 1991 by Arrow as a looper, and converted into a hypercoaster by DH Morgan in 2001. The POVs looked fantastic, and Canobie Coaster spoke really highly of it. Unfortunately I was a bit underwhelmed. The second drop is great, but the ride feels a bit short, and the airtime didn&#39;t really hit as hard as I was hoping. At least it was plenty smooth.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/RgGEsvcl.jpg">Steel Curtain</a></strong> (2x, middle) - Now this coaster was just as crazy as it appeared! A whopping 9 inversions and some surprising airtime moments on this 2019 S&amp;S monster. The coaster starts with an insane 197 ft dive drop inspired by the infamous Drachen Fire and doesn&#39;t let up from that point. I would not describe the ride as glass-smooth, but the roughness is more of a vibration than a rattle or rumble, so it&#39;s plenty tolerable. The intense inversions and whippy turns with minimal restraints make this ride really special. And I say this as a Jets fan: the Steelers theming was actually pretty cool. If the Jets had a coaster it&#39;d be a TOGO.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JBjRQral.jpg">Sky Rocket</a></strong> (2x, front and middle) - I really enjoyed this 2010 Premier prototype coaster. It starts with a solid LSM launch and short top hat which provides a slight bit of airtime. A brake holds the train at the crest of the hill before going into a vertical drop. There&#39;s some great inversions, specifically a fantastic zero-G roll and full corkscrew towards the end. I like the wacky ending with the gentle S-curves and bunny hills. While the Sky Rocket II is more ubiquitous and more intense, I prefer this ride overall.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ON1JMSol.jpg">Thunderbolt</a></strong> (2x, front and back) - I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from this park&#39;s three 100-year-old woodies, but these rides are absolutely fantastic! Originally a Miller design built in 1924 as Pippin, this coaster was heavily redesigned by Andy Vettel in 1968 and renamed Thunderbolt. The current design has some great airtime over the four drops into the adjacent ravine. If you love stomach-dropping-out moments on woodies, Thunderbolt is your ideal coaster. The twister/helix section has some super strong laterals, and because of the lack of a seat divider, the outside rider gets absolutely pummeled (that&#39;d be me). While the airtime is good from the back, the front had one particular pop of ejector that rocketed my wife and I right into the buzz bars. Most would consider this Kennywood&#39;s best woodie, but I&#39;m not totally sold on that.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/J1JqkPAl.jpg">Racer</a></strong> (2x, both sides) - A very unique 1927 Miller design that utilizes a Mobius loop layout rather than two separate tracks. This ride is relatively tame, but the racing element is just unmatched. The closeness of the two racing trains makes for excellent trash talk. The facade of the station is a restoration of the original 1920s design and it is a real thing of beauty. And how many coasters are on the National Register of Historic Places?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/tjZkyEEl.jpg">Jack Rabbit</a></strong> (2x, middle and back) - The answer to the previous question is that there are <em>two</em> registered at Kennywood alone. Jack Rabbit is the oldest in the park, also designed by John Miller, built by the legendary Harry Baker. The ride&#39;s most unique characteristic are its Vettel trains with unmoving lap bars and only a seat belt to really hold you in. With these truly minimal restraints, the airtime in the back row is ridiculous, especially on the coaster&#39;s signature double dip element. Of the three woodies in the park, this is the one that I wanted to reride the most.</li>
<li><strong>Exterminator</strong> (0x) - Allegedly this is a spinning wild mouse that&#39;s indoors. However the line moved incredibly slowly, we got cut like 12 separate times, and then the ride broke down after waiting for 30 minutes. We decided to leave the queue and didn&#39;t get back over there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some really cool old-school flats here as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto Race</strong> - A Traver-designed car ride on wooden track from 1930. Unfortunately seems to have been heavily modified in its operation, so it doesn&#39;t offer the vintage experience anymore. (Knoebels would <em>never!</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Gran Prix</strong> - Bumper cars with the most heinous, disgusting shoulder straps I have ever had the displeasure of wearing. They&#39;re lined with some kind of strange faux-wool/fur material that reeks of armpits of the past.</li>
<li><strong>Kangaroo</strong> - A last-of-its-kind circular, bouncy flat that was almost permanently removed a few years ago. Glad the park listened to its fans.</li>
<li><strong>Merry-Go-Round</strong> - Another gorgeous vintage Carousel with a beautiful Wurlitzer organ.</li>
<li><strong>Turtle</strong> - Another last-of-its-kind ride by Traver, located between Phantom and Thunderbolt.</li>
<li><strong>Whip</strong> - A fantastic vintage 1926 Mangels Whip! Pretty interesting to have a Whip without any overhang or roof.</li>
<li><strong>Ghostwood Estate</strong> - Actually a pretty cool haunted house with a shooting game. I&#39;d honestly recommend just putting the laser gun down and appreciating the theming, because I really liked it.</li>
<li><strong>Noah&#39;s Ark</strong> - What the hell ass balls is this? I thought Herb Schmeck only made coasters but apparently he also was responsible for manmade horrors beyond our comprehension. Those who suffer from motion sickness or claustrophobia may want to skip this. Glad I went through it anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Old Mill</strong> - The oldest ride at Kennywood, all the way back from 1901. This was a relaxing boat ride with goofy, fun theming.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we started the trip with two small, quirky regional parks: Knoebels and Waldameer. We moved on to larger corporate-owned parks, Cedar Point and Kings Island. Kennywood brought us right back to the beginning of the trip with its enjoyable idiosyncracies and unique ride lineup.</p>
<p>The park&#39;s setting is pretty unique as well. You get a great view of the Monongahela River from some of the taller rides, as well as the US Steel factory on the opposite bank of the river.</p>
<p>Kennywood&#39;s ability to maintain these three woodies to still be smooth, fun rides is a remarkable feat. They must put a lot of love into those rides. I felt the three steel coasters were very comfortable as well, with only Steel Curtain being the slightest bit rough at times.</p>
<p>With such a small park, it&#39;s easy to navigate, and not difficult to find any given ride. The hardest rides to locate were the Whip and Exterminator as they&#39;re tucked behind the fountain and shoot-the-chute.</p>
<p>A couple of days before we got to Kennywood, the park announced extended hours, so they were actually open until 10pm that night. We only stayed until about 7 or so, but it&#39;s cool that the park can do that on such short notice. It&#39;s a good treat for the fans.</p>
<p>Speaking of the fans, the crowds here were just a little bit rowdy compared to other parks, and a bit denser and younger than what we had experienced elsewhere. More packs of teenagers, fewer families. Sadly this gave the park a little bit of a &quot;peak summer Six Flags&quot; feel that we had managed to avoid up to this point. I don&#39;t really consider this a negative on the park itself, but it didn&#39;t help the overall experience.</p>
<p>Hotels in the area are hard to come by, and quite frankly, I would not recommend staying in or around West Mifflin. The surrounding area can be very sketchy. We ended up staying about 15 minutes away in a town called Monroeville. We got breakfast on the way to the park at Drew&#39;s Family Restaurant in Pittsburgh, a solid breakfast for a decent price.</p>
<p>We got dinner on the way out of town at a nearby Primanti Bros, which <em>always</em> goes hard. With two days left in the trip, we&#39;d be spending the next day at the park I&#39;m most familiar with, my spiritual home park: the sweetest place on Earth.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quaint, small park with a surprising lineup of vintage woodies</li>
<li>Some really interesting last-of-their-kind vintage flats</li>
<li>Kind of a sketchy area</li>
<li>Get some Primanti Bros in your mouth while you&#39;re in the Pittsburgh area</li>
</ul>
